:tada: This project was made for my college, it was a job where the idea was making a Customer Register, where I used the language C# with MySQL, Windows Forms and Reports Viewer. The MVC design pattern was used in this project.

The project has a problem not solved, it was the insertion of information in the database, the persistent layer needs to be checked.
